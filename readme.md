## My Casual Repo

This repository is just an collection of my trail code while learning **C++ primer**. It also helps me familarize with the git usages. 

So, noted that this repo does **not make any sense**. It is just my own playground.

### 1. How to Upload local project to GitHub

Initially, I already have some cpp files locally. Now, I want to creat a github repo and put everyting up-to-date on it. Can we do that just using shell?

I find the solution from this [githubdocs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github?platform=mac). It suggestes us do it with [Github CLI](), which enables us use command line to control our repo on Github. At first, we need to initialize the local directory as a Git repository:

```bash
git init -b main
```

After this command, one `.git` folder will be created under the curent folder. Then, stage and commit all the files in our project with:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
```

To create a repository for your project on GitHub, use the `gh repo create` subcommand. When prompted, select **Push an existing local repository to GitHub** and enter the desired name for your repository.

Now, we have successfully created a Github repo based on our working directory.

### 2. Play with Branches

Initially, I am confused with the git concepts and lingos, such as `master`, `origin`, `remote`. Now, I start to understand that *master* is the <u>branch</u>, which     usually serves as a main branch, and *origin* is the alias of the remote host, which can be monitored by  `git remote -v`. With this command, we can know the exact host where we fetch the online code in the current branch from, and push our code to.

For example, if we want to add a remote from Paul, with the url `https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit` and fetch the code from this new remote:

```bash
$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)
```

Now we can use the string `pb` on the command line, standing for the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don't yet have in your repository, you can run `git fetch pb`:

```bash
$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)
Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.
From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
 * [new branch]      master     -> pb/master
 * [new branch]      ticgit     -> pb/ticgit
```

Paul‚Äôs `master` branch is now accessible locally as `pb/master`‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâyou can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it.

From then on, it has been a little bit tricky. Because it leads to `merge`, `checkout` and some other concepts. But they are all centered around branches. So, that is why I want to play with branches in this section.

#### 1) Requirements

This repo is mainly for three different tasks:

1. cpp primer trail;
2. labuladong algorithm;
3. csapp labs

So, I might as well create three different braches corresponding to these tasks, practicing usage of branches of github. And I am required to conduct the task under the specific branch.

#### 2) Usages

Firstly, I need to create branch named `cpp-trail`:

```bash
git brach cpp-trail
```

Then, stage the modifications and upload it to the remote:

```bash
$ git commit -m "add branch"
$ git push -u origin cpp-trail
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 2.00 KiB | 2.00 MiB/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'cpp-trail' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/Steven-cpp/MyCasualRepo/pull/new/cpp-trail
remote: 
To https://github.com/Steven-cpp/MyCasualRepo.git
 * [new branch]      cpp-trail -> cpp-trail
Branch 'cpp-trail' set up to track remote branch 'cpp-trail' from 'origin'.
```

We can see that, this branch has also been created in the remote.

### 3. Containers in cpp

Now we continue our C++ Primer learning path from *containers*. Grasping the STL containers in C++ is of great importance. So I created `/01_containers` for all my practices that play with containers.

In C++, container is divided into *sequential container*, *associative container*, and *container adapters*. There are three container adapters: stack, queue, and priority_queue. Essentially, an adaptor is a mechanism for making one thing act like another. A container adaptor takes an existing container type and makes it act like a different type. For example, the `stack` adaptor takes a sequential container (other than `array` or `forward_list`) and makes it operate as if it were a stack.

By default both `stack` and `queue` are implemented in terms of `deque`, and a `priority_queue` is implemented on a `vector`. We can override the default container type by naming a sequential container as a second type argument when we create the adaptor:

```cpp
// empty stack implemented on top of vector 
stack<string, vector<string>> str_stk; 
// str_stk2 is implemented on top of vector and initially holds a copy of svec 
stack<string, vector<string>> str_stk2(svec);
```

For the most part, the containers deÔ¨Åne surprisingly few operations, only including construct, add & remove elements, return specific iterators. Other useful operations, such as **sorting or searching, are deÔ¨Åned not by the container types but by the standard algorithms**. In this way, we just need to define and remember the independent generalized algorithm, saving ourselves from dealing with every container.

#### 1) Memory Mangement

All the containers (except array) provide efÔ¨Åcient dynamic memory management. We may add elements to the container without worrying about where to store the elements. The container itself manages its storage. Both `vector` and `string` provide more detailed control over memory management through their `reserve` and `capacity` members.

#### 2) Generic Alogorithm

The library containers deÔ¨Åne a surprisingly small set of operations. Rather than adding lots of functionality to each container, the library provides a set of algorithms, most of which are independent of any particular container type. These algorithms are *generic*: They operate on different types of containers and on elements of various types. We just need to pass in the iterators and target value to use it, such as *searching* and *sorting*.

Noted that, the generic algorithms do not themselves execute container operations. They operate solely in terms of iterators and iterator operations. The fact that the algorithms operate in terms of iterators and not container operations has a perhaps surprising but essential implication: **Algorithms never change the size of the underlying container**. Algorithms <u>may change the values</u> of the elements stored in the container, and they <u>may move elements</u> around within the container. They do not, however, ever add or remove elements directly.

**Read-only Algorithms**

Use `find(3)` to find target value `val` from the given interval in a container. It returns an iterator to the Ô¨Årst element that is equal to that value. If there is no match, find returns the second parameter (always end of the interval) to indicate failure.

```cpp
// value we‚Äôll look for 
int val = 42; 
// result will denote the element we want if it‚Äôs in vec,
// OR vec.cend() if not
auto result = find(vec.cbegin(), vec.cend(), val); 
// report the result 
cout << "The value " << val << (result == vec.cend() ? " is not present" : " is present") << endl;
```

Use `accumulate(3)` to sum up over the given interval. Thanks to its third parameter, we can calculate the sum as long as the type supports `+` operator.

```cpp
// Basic case: integer sum
int sum = accumulate(vec.cbegin(), vec.cend(), 0);
// Can also be used to concatenate strings together
string sum = accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), string(""));
```

> üîç **When to Use Const Iterators**
>
> Ordinarily it is best to use `cbegin()` and `cend()` with algorithms that read, but do not write, the elements. However, if you plan to use the iterator returned by the algorithm to change an element‚Äôs value, then you need to pass `begin()` and `end()`.

### 4. Comments

[Documenting C++ Code](https://developer.lsst.io/cpp/api-docs.html)

It is always a good practice to add clear and concise comment to our codes. When it comes to cpp, what is the best practice to document our code?

#### 1) Comment on Functions

A series of `@param` tags, usually one for each parameter. Each tag should have a description following the parameter name. You do *not* usually need to document default arguments; Doxygen will provide the default automatically. If the description extends over multiple lines, each line after the first must be indented.

Parameters should be listed in the same order as they appear in the function or method signature. Make sure to keep the parameter list in sync with the actual parameters; Doxygen will issue a warning if they don‚Äôt match.

`@param` should be given with the `[in]`, `[out]`, or `[in, out]` tag if the function method contains any output parameters. The `[in]` tag is optional if all parameters are input, even if other functions or methods in the same class or package use output parameters.

```cpp
/**
 * Compute mean and standard deviation for a collection of data.
 *
 * @param[out] mean the mean of `data`, or `NaN` if `data` is empty
 * @param[out] stdDev the unbiased (sample) standard deviation, or `NaN`
 *     if `data` contains fewer than 2 elements
 * @param[in] data the data to analyze
 */
void computeStatistics(double & mean, double & stdDev, std::vector<double> const & data);
```

When two or more consecutive parameters have *exactly* the same description, they can be combined:

```cpp
/**
 * @param x, y the coordinates where the function is evaluated
 */
```
